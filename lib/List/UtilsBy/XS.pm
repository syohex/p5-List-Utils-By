=head1 NAME

List::UtilsBy::XS - XS implementation of List::UtilsBy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use List::UtilsBy::XS qw(sort_by);

  sort_by { $_->{foo} } @hash_ref_list

You can use those functions same as List::UtilsBy ones,
but some functions have limitation. See L<LIMITATION> section.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

List::UtilsBy::XS is XS implamentation of List::UtilsBy.
Functions are more fast than original ones.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Same as L<List::UtilsBy>.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Some functions are implemented by lightweight callback API.
C<sort_by>, C<rev_sort_by>, C<nsort_by>, C<rev_nsort_by>,
C<min_by>, C<max_by>, C<uniq_by>, C<partion_by>, C<count_by>,
C<extract_by>, C<weighted_shuffle_by> are limitated some features.

Limitations are:

=head2 Can't change argument C<$_>

You can't modify C<$_> in callback subroutine.

=head2 Can't access to arguments as C<@_>

You can access argument as only C<$_> and cannot access as C<@_>,
C<$_[n]>.
